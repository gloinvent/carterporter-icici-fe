                          Carterx.in. A recent directive from RBI makes it
                          mandatory to have an additional authentication pass
                          code verified by VISA (VBV) or MSC (Master Secure
                          Code) which has to be entered by online users while
                          paying online using visa or master credit card. It
                          means extra security for customers, thus making online
                          payments safer.
